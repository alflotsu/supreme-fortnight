   - Icons and placeholder text use the secondary light color `#95c6a9`
   - Header buttons updated to use secondary light color instead of white

3. **Semantic CSS**: Replaced direct Tailwind classes with semantic CSS classes for better maintainability

4. **Android UI Migration**: Successfully migrated core Android components to use the Stitch Design System
   - Created new Stitch components (StitchCard, StitchHeading, StitchText)
   - Updated existing components to use Stitch color scheme and typography
   - Integrated LocalStitchColorScheme throughout the app
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing Stitch components

5. **Visual Consistency**: All components now visually match the reference documentation

## Verification

All components have been verified against the reference files to ensure:
- Color values are exactly matching
- Text colors on accent elements are correct
- Layout and spacing are consistent
- Header button colors are properly updated
- Android UI components use the Stitch Design System

The updated sample HTML file demonstrates all these changes while maintaining full functionality.
